# Plotly.js-Challenge -- Exploring Belly Button Biodiversity
<hr>

* For this challenge, an interactive dashboard was built for the purpose of exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which can be found at: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/. This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) are present in more than 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare.

* To complete the data exploration, the Plotly D3 Javascript library was used to create three visualizations for each subject in the trial. These visualizations are accessed via dropdown menu.

* Additionally, each dropdown option includes the subject metadata persisting of ID, Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Location, Body Type, and Frequency of Washes.

## Visualizations:

* For each subject, three visualizations are available: 1. a horizontal bar chart of the top ten most prevalent OTUs in the sample, 2. a bubble chart of all OTUs in the sample, and 3. a guage of the subject's recorded weekly wash frequency. The bar chart and the bubble chart are further interactive in that hovering over the specific bar or bubble will give the scientific name of the OTU represented.
